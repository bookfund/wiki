Newsreaders
===========

To download something from the Usenet, you will need a newsreader, that can either be an old style newsreader where you subscribe to groups and then select all the files you want manually, or you can use a modern NZB downloader, if you are not interested in the discussion part of it all.


We will only list software that can be used for free, premium Usenet [access](Providers) is expensive enough already.
