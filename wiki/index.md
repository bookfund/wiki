Welcome to the bookfund wiki
============================

The **bookfund** wiki is a place where we compile infos regarding audiobooks on [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet). If you want to contribute, please feel free to do so. 

What you will need:
-------------------

To enjoy Usenet downloads to the fullest, you will need access to a premium Usenet provider. If you are lucky enough, your ISP offers free Usenet access, but there are not many of those left. You can check [here](http://www.usenettools.net/ISP.htm) to see if your ISP does.


On our [overview](Providers), you can find a list of premium providers that we can recommend.



You will also need a Newsreader or an NZB downloader to get to the files you want. We have a compiled a list of software that you can use on our [Newsreader](Newsreaders) page.
